seemingly complex and fast moves should be doabe by even new players 
things seen on video should be replicable easily (opposite end of line ups on valo where u need pixel perfect accuracy)
how games have so much variety in them , if u ever add a slashing thing to ur game make to add a lot of diff knifes and shit 
and it should be evident right of the bat noticable 

also riding rockets , havnt decided if with or without steering , one thing maybe is without steering but inf range 
typical dual grapples 
fast dashes (multiple)
and ninja star throw and teleport 



slow section with a mech , where throwing a punch is like a fighter plane cockppit where u have to move ur mouse and hit buttons and levers to make the mech move a specific way 
like looking around doesnt make the mech look around get it ?
ok so the mech section controls would work like this 
right click immediatly locks the camera to the right hand (so ur view moves to the hand not other way around ) then u can control it by moving ur mouse as usual 
same for left hand 
use e to perform action (idk like cockppit buttons) and maybe q to grab (and it will be toggle like when u stop pressing mouse button hand remains grabbed to the device)

it would also mean u can grab and press e if u want 

also a spring that is the opposite of a grapple where u have to look behind u at a wall to push forward 
while grapple has a max velocity after which the wire breaks when u try to change direction (like moving forward u try to move back if u are too fast the line snaps)
where as for springs the speed just builds up 


story wise :
the earth is becoming over populated and dying so the billionares and gov officials create a ship with all the important people and leave earth , soon the peasant dont / are not at all interested in war 
the elite find out earth has healed and comeback but want to gain back control of the earth 
the story starts from the "invader's" perspective and there the propaganda is the that people on earth actually kicked these people out 
uk show excess/ how elite say the commom people to save water while they have pools 
oh ya water should be a big issue (cause Albert )
they have mechs but the people on earth have primitive ones , while invades have full on robots and pilots along with advance mechs 

oh ya guns , bigger guns aim like tanks in wt , ammo count has to be change



also randomly an other csgo like game 
where bombs are coded with a unique 5-6 digit code and defusers have to play that game of wordguesser 
guns are automatically balanced cause bigger guns aim like tanks in wt
