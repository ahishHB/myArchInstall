: //this is a diff step 

: install arch iso from archlinux.org/downloads (spell idk)

:use rofus or something and make a bootable usb , then boot to it 
:check internet connection (use ethernet)
:$timedatectl set-ntp true
:$lsblk //note the name of the hardware u want to install it in  // sda1 and sda 2 or nvme01p1 etc etc 
:make a partitions for 128M grub and rest for linux itself
type can be of DOS or GPT ,if gpt u wont have the bootable flag ,from what i have read grub ignores it anyway
:now format the 2 partitions
the 128M $mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 		(or eqvivalent)
do the same for the other partition
:mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3 			(or eqvi)
:$ mount /dev/sda3 /mnt 		(the non grub partition) 
:$ mkdir /mnt/boot 			(make boot folder )
:$ mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot 		(mount the boot to boot folder )
:$ pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware vim
//making fstab (look up tab for ur system to load stuff)
//make sure to use uuid not just device id cause device id can change, uuid is constant 
:$ genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
//now to change root to the install iso
:$ arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
//u can type ls to confirm u are in root 
:$ pacman -S networkmanager grub
//self explanatory 
//optional :$ systemctl enable NetworkManager 
//to have internet whenever u boot 
//grub installation
make sure u have the 128M partition as EFI type not as linux type 
grub issue !!!
	couldnt fine efi directory 
	make sure the sda1 is for type fat32
	umount /dev/sda1 
	mkdir /boot/EFI (caps needed)
	then remount to /boot/EFI
	if it says efibootmgr not found use pacman to install it again
	then just use grub-install /dev/sda (no numbers)

:$ grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg (regardless of error in previous step)



1 and 3 only
remember



when he says sda2 then use sda3
sda 1 is just sda 1
password of it is 1234
