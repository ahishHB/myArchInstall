if pacman doesnt work try to disable SigLevel in /etc/pacman.conf by replacing it with never 

to check for ur ip address

to unzip files 
    tar -<flags> <filename> -C <target directory>
    flags - 
        x -> extract (uncompressed)
        f -> specific file only
        v -> verbose output
        z -> for gzip only
		j -> bsdtar bzip2
		J -> xz type

		c -> compress
        t -> list contents without unzipping (use with f flag)
	use bsdtar with the xvzf flag to unzip .zip files
tar -zcvf arcName.tar.gz dirname1 dirname2 etc etc

in visual mode highlight the required text and press y to yank it or d to cut it

to refactor a variable in vim 
	go the name of the variable then press gD(globally used) or gd(int scope)
	then ur cursor should be on the name of the variable
	then press c gn (change new name )then type the name u want it to be 
	then press esc then if u want to go step by step press . repeatedly
	if u want all occurensses then type :%norm. 


to refactor a variable in a local scope 
	go to the variable
	press gd
	go to visial modeselect the full scope u want to replace
	press colon twice :: as u can get garbage (like ''<,'>'), i firgured out pressing :: twice isnt required double// takes care of it but this sucks dont do it , just use :: it takes care of scope
	then press s//<name of new >/gc then press y as u go on 


##
REFACTORING THE RIGHT WAY:
##

	go to the first time the variable is used (in a specific scope if u want , but u can press gD to go to the very first time it was used )
	then press shift+v to go to visual line , then go till the scope u want (or full file)
	then press :: (u will get bs like ;<:>; something similar ignore it its ok)
	then press s//<name of new name for variable>/gc then hit enter then press y as u go on 



when making an array in a function remember that u cant return the array no matter what you do , u can return the memory location but after the function is executed it is taken as un allocated 


// compiling using g++ >> g++ mainfile.cpp classfile.cpp -lm -o test 
	this only works if the classes are linked properly , the classfile.cpp should have the include "classfile.hpp" 
	and the mainfile should also include "classfile.hpp"
	also remember to use include protections

vim by default can only copy 50 lines so make sure u reset it 

vim -p file1 file2 use gt gT to move between tabs
or while in vim u can :tabedit file2 // to open new tabs
use gt gT or Gt i forget to switch between tabs

to indent use visual mode to highlight text and press shift+ < 
also press . to repeat the indent action 







/// to find any file in ur system

$find / -type f -iname filename.txt
	f means it is a file 
	-iname = ignore case sensitivity


kde connect -
dbus-launch kdeconnect-cli -l or something 

 ping -f www.geeksforgeeks.org


 chown :wheel filename // this makes sure the group permissons are updated to wheel grp
 chown ahish filename // this makes sure the owner is set
 chmod -R 777 file name is the way to ensure OwnerGroupOthers basically 3 digit binary setter ReadWriteExe
ffmpeg -i file.mp3 -af "highpass=f=200, lowpass=f=300" out.mp3

use bsdtar to unzip .zip files

how to create ur own systemd deamon 

making a daemon from C :
	

write ur script as usual 
go to /etc/systemd/system/ 
create a file.service file 
in that file 

vim in visual highlight a text area and press u or Shift+u 
to convert to uppercase or lower case 

fsck to fix sd card when it crashes 
when it doesnt login after a while then control + alt + F5 or somthing usually 
apparently it opens an other terminal 

vim navigation:
	use b and e to begin and end of a word use shift to ignore punctuation
	type a number then shiftG
	use shift K to get definition 

make: 
	when using make do this instead 
	time make -j$(nproc*1.5) &> error.txt 
	to capture all errors and use all cores

groups / chmod:
	7 7 7
	owner grp others
	ls -l lists these 
	u can see available grps in /etc/group	
	
	every file has 1 owner 1 group 
	!! ever user belongs to 1 or more groups 
	every group has associated permissons for it ( _7_ )
	eg: file display > belongs to grp screen 
	all users who are associated with screen can access display 
	however the owner (creator usually ) of the file can limit some things for grps or others 


installing .img os:
	use fdisk -l on the file to get te partitions 
	use dd on the files to load it on to the usb or device
	the device must not be mounted 
	dd if=path/to/inputfile of=path/to/outputfile

delete a drive fully
	use dd if=/dev/zero of=drive

bluetooth:
	basically u need to 
	sudo pacman -S pulseaudio-bluetooth , bluetoothctl 
	edit 
	/etc/pulse/default.pa 

	there is an if block (mid way the file) for the bluetooth
	copy the load-module lines (2 lines from 2 if blocks)
	and load it unconditionally 
	use bluetoothctl cli
	power on
	agent on 
	default agent ## only if u want to autoconnect

	scan on
	trust MAC
	pair MAC
	connect MAC
